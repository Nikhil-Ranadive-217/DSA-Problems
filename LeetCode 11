Problem:- Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water finds max area between two vertical lines and x-axis. Two pointers O(n) greedy strategy.[conversation_history]

#Java Implementation (Two Pointers)

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int currentArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);
            
            // Move shorter pointer (area limited by height)
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
}

Greedy insight: Move shorter pointer - can't improve area with current bottleneck.

#Step-by-Step Logic
Pointers: left=0, right=n-1 (max width)
Area: min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
Update: maxArea = max(maxArea, currentArea)
Greedy move:
height[left] < height[right] → left++
Otherwise → right--
Terminate: left >= right
Trace: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
text
left=0(1),right=8(7): area=1*8=8
1<7 → left=1(8),right=8(7): area=7*7=49 ✓
8>7 → right=7(3): area=3*6=18  
8>3 → right=6(8): area=4*5=20
... max=49

#Thought Process
Brute O(n²): All pairs → TLE.
Greedy revelation:
text
Area = min(height) * width
Shorter line limits area → move it (might find taller)
Taller line worth keeping (potential for larger area)
Why optimal: Never miss better solution by discarding worse height.
Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

#Edge Cases
n=2: [1,1] → 1*1=1
All same height: [2,2,2] → 2*2=4 (max width)
Increasing: [1,2,3] → ends 1*2=2
Single line: n=1 → while false → 0
