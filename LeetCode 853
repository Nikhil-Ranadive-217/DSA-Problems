Problem:-Car Fleet

There are n cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.
You are given two integer arrays position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car in miles per hour.
A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.
A car fleet is a single car or a group of cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the minimum speed of any car in the fleet.
If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.
Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

Example 1:
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]

Output: 3
Explanation:

The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target

solutions:- 

Car Fleet counts distinct fleets arriving at target. Stack-based time-to-target calculation.

#Java Implementation (Stack)

class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        // Pair position/speed, sort by position DESC (right to left)
        int n = position.length;
        Integer[] indices = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) indices[i] = i;
        
        Arrays.sort(indices, (i1, i2) -> position[i2] - position[i1]);
        
        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();  // Time to target
        
        for (int idx : indices) {
            double time = (target - position[idx]) * 1.0 / speed[idx];
            
            // If slower than top fleet, forms new fleet
            if (stack.isEmpty() || time > stack.peek()) {
                stack.push(time);
            }
        }
        
        return stack.size();
    }
}

Process right→left: Each car either joins previous fleet or starts new.

#Step-by-Step Logic
Sort cars: Rightmost → leftmost (position descending)
Stack: Tracks fleet arrival times (slower = later)
For each car (right to left):
Calculate time = (target-pos)/speed
time > stack.top() → slower fleet → new fleet
time ≤ stack.top() → catches up → joins previous
Result: stack.size()
Trace: target=12, pos=[10,8,0,5,3], speed=[2,4,1,1,3]

Sort: idx=[0,1,3,4,2] (pos:10,8,5,3,0)
Car0(10,2): time=(12-10)/2=1.0 → stack=[1.0]
Car1(8,4): time=1.0 ≤ 1.0 → join
Car3(5,1): time=7.0 > 1.0 → stack=[1.0,7.0]  
Car4(3,3): time=3.0 < 7.0 → join 7.0
Car2(0,1): time=12.0 > 7.0 → stack=[1.0,7.0,12.0]

#Thought Process
Key insight: Right-to-left processing

text
Car A catches fleet B iff: timeA ≤ timeB
Faster car (smaller time) joins slower fleet ahead
Stack maintains: Non-increasing arrival times

text
New fleet only when strictly slower than previous fleet
Why sort descending: Process destination→start direction

Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)

#Edge Cases
All same speed: All join → 1 fleet
Same position: Slowest determines fleet time
Already at target: time=0 → joins fleet
Single car: 1 fleet
