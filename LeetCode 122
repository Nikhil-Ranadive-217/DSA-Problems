roblem:-Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the same day, ensuring you never hold more than one share of the stock.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Solution:-

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II maximizes profit with multiple buy/sell transactions (one share limit). Greedy: capture every uphill.[conversation_history]

#Java Implementation (Greedy Add All Ups)

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
}

Greedy insight: Buy low → sell high on EVERY consecutive increase. Equivalent to optimal multi-transaction strategy.[conversation_history]

#Step-by-Step Logic
Iterate day 1 to n: Compare prices[i] vs prices[i-1]
If uphill: profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
Downhill: Skip (no sell at loss)
Result: Sum of all positive daily gains
Example trace: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
text
i=1: 1<7 → skip (0)
i=2: 5>1 → +4 (4)  
i=3: 3<5 → skip (4)
i=4: 6>3 → +3 (7)
i=5: 4<6 → skip (7) ✓

#Thought Process
Optimal insight: Any profitable sequence buy→...→sell can be split into consecutive uphill segments without loss.

Why greedy works:
text
Buy@1→sell@5 profit=4  OR  Buy@1→3 (+2) + Buy@3→5 (+2) = 4 ✓
No penalty for "extra" transactions!
DP alt: dp[i][0/1] (hold/not hold) = O(n) space vs O(1).
Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

#Edge Cases
Length 1: [7] → 0 (no transaction)
Sorted decreasing: [7,6,5,4] → 0
Sorted increasing: [1,2,3,4] → 3 (1→2→3→4)
Plateau: [1,1,1] → 0
Peak-valley: [1,3,2,4] → 4 (1→3 + 2→4)
