Problem:- Baseball Game
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

An integer x.
Record a new score of x.
'+'.
Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
'D'.
Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
'C'.
Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.

 
Example 1:

Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

LeetCode 682: Baseball Game simulates strange scoring rules using stack/array + running total. O(n) simple iteration.

#Java Implementation (Array + Running Sum)

class Solution {
    public int calPoints(String[] ops) {
        int[] record = new int[ops.length];
        int top = -1;  // Stack top index
        int total = 0;
        
        for (String op : ops) {
            switch (op) {
                case "C":
                    if (top >= 0) {
                        total -= record[top];
                        top--;
                    }
                    break;
                case "D":
                    if (top >= 0) {
                        int doubled = record[top] * 2;
                        record[++top] = doubled;
                        total += doubled;
                    }
                    break;
                case "+":
                    if (top >= 1) {
                        int sum = record[top] + record[top - 1];
                        record[++top] = sum;
                        total += sum;
                    }
                    break;
                default:  // Integer score
                    int score = Integer.parseInt(op);
                    record[++top] = score;
                    total += score;
            }
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}

Array as stack: top index simulates stack operations.

#Step-by-Step Logic
Array record: Stores valid scores
top index: Current stack top (-1 = empty)
For each operation:
"C": Remove top, total -= record[top--]
"D": Double top, total += record[top] * 2
"+": Sum top 2, total += record[top] + record[top-1]
Integer: Add score, total += score
Result: total
Trace: ["5","2","C","D","+"]

text
"5": record[0]=5, top=0, total=5
"2": record[1]=2, top=1, total=7  
"C": total-=2=5, top=0
"D": record[1]=10, top=1, total=15
"+": record[2]=15, top=2, total=30 ✓

#Thought Process
Stack classic: Last-in-first-out perfect for C, D, +
Array vs Deque: Array faster, pre-allocated size known
Running total: Update on add/remove → O(1) final sum
Switch efficient: Clean operation dispatch

Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

#Edge Cases
Empty: [] → 0
Single: ["1"] → 1
All C: ["1","C"] → 0
C on empty: Skip (guaranteed valid)
Large numbers: 32-bit safe (per constraints)
